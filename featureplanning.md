  }

  async getBestMove(fen, timeLimit = 1000) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      this.stockfish.postMessage(`position fen ${fen}`);
      this.stockfish.postMessage(`go movetime ${timeLimit}`);
      
      this.stockfish.onmessage = (event) => {
        if (event.data.includes('bestmove')) {
          const move = event.data.split(' ')[1];
          resolve(move);
        }

      process.env.ALGOD_PORT
    );
  }

  async createNFT(metadata, creatorAddress) {
    const txn = algosdk.makeAssetCreateTxnWithSuggestedParams(
      creatorAddress,
      undefined,
      1, // Total supply
      0, // Decimals
      false, // Default frozen
      undefined, // Manager
      undefined, // Reserve
      undefined, // Freeze
      undefined, // Clawback
      'CHECKMATE', // Unit name
      'Checkmate NFT', // Asset name
      metadata.ipfsUrl,
      undefined,
      await this.algodClient.getTransactionParams().do()
    );
    
    return txn;
  }

  async transferNFT(assetId, fromAddress, toAddress, amount = 1) {
    // NFT transfer logic
  }
}
```

#### IPFS Integration for NFT Metadata
```javascript
// IPFS service for NFT storage
class IPFSService {
  constructor() {
    this.ipfs = create({
      host: process.env.IPFS_HOST,
      port: process.env.IPFS_PORT,
      protocol: 'https'
    });
  }

  async uploadNFTMetadata(gameData, imageData) {
    const metadata = {
      name: `Checkmate #${gameData.gameId}`,
      description: `Epic checkmate from game ${gameData.gameId}`,
      image: await this.uploadImage(imageData),
      attributes: [
        { trait_type: 'Game Type', value: gameData.timeControl },
        { trait_type: 'Moves', value: gameData.moveCount },
        { trait_type: 'Rating Difference', value: gameData.ratingDiff }
      ],
      game_data: {
        pgn: gameData.pgn,
        final_position: gameData.finalFen,
        checkmate_move: gameData.checkmateMove
      }
    };

    const result = await this.ipfs.add(JSON.stringify(metadata));
    return result.path;
  }
}
```
