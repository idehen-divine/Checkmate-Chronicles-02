## Immediate Next Steps (This Session)

### Priority 1: Verify Current Setup
1. **Check Yarn Installation Status**: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
2. **Test Application Startup**: Verify the app runs without errors
3. **Test Supabase Connection**: Ensure database connectivity is working

### Priority 2: Fix Any Immediate Issues
1. **Authentication Flow**: Test Google OAuth and fix any configuration issues
2. **Navigation**: Ensure all routes and navigation components work properly
3. **Data Loading**: Verify services are working with mock data

### Priority 3: Plan Next Development Sprint
1. **Identify Blockers**: Find any issues preventing further development
2. **Prioritize Features**: Determine which features to implement first
3. **Set Development Goals**: Define clear objectives for the next phase

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Keep all changes simple and minimal impact
- Use TypeScript strictly with proper type definitions
- Follow Angular and Ionic best practices
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use the established utility classes and services

### Package Management Rules
- **MANDATORY**: Use Yarn exclusively for all package operations
- Never use npm commands
- Always use `yarn add` for new dependencies
- Use `yarn install` for dependency installation

### Testing Strategy
- Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
- Verify authentication flows thoroughly
- Test navigation between all pages
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

## Notes
- The project has a solid foundation with good architecture
- Database schema is already created and ready to use
- Authentication system is set up but needs testing
- UI/UX design is well-implemented and responsive
- Ready to move from mock data to real database integration

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete database integration and authentication testing
2. Implement real data services to replace mock data
3. Ensure all current features are fully functional
4. Plan the next major feature development phase
